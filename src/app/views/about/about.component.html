              <p class="lead text-secondary mb-0">
                We exist to document, preserve, and elevate evidence of unlawful violence by ICE agents.
                Our goal is simple: create a trustworthy record that can support accountability efforts and be
                shared with civil-rights advocates, including the ACLU.

              <p class="mb-2 text-secondary">
                For months, community members have reported excessive force with little to no consequence.
                This platform helps you turn incidents into structured, verifiable documentation. Your report
                won’t be just a social post—it will be evidence capable of review by attorneys, investigators,
                and journalists.
